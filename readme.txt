This repository contains the source and documentation for the project named Smart Hear. As the name suggests the project aims to provide a smart hearing aid in the form of smart phoe for specially abled people. The basic idea behind the application is to record the audio around the user and provide the useful information extracted form it to the user. The user can also alter the featuers of the audio such as pitch, tempo, bass etc to suit his or hear hearing ability. One use case for this would be to notify the user in case an alarm bell goes off or the door bell rings. The future extension to this idea would be to perform context based analyisis on the audio sources of the user to ensure that the efficiency is improved while cutting down on the energy consumed by the user.
